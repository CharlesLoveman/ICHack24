## Steps

# Windows (Command Prompt)

Makes sure you're inside the Scripts folder.

Make sure you've got a venv made, called `venv`. If not, run `b_create.bat`. Also a MongoDB with `C:\data\db` created.

Create 3 terminals, running the following scripts in each:
1) `b_install.bat`, `b_run.bat`
2) `f_install.bat`, `f_run.bat`
3) `m_run.bat`
