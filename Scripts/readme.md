# Steps

## Windows (Command Prompt)

Make sure your working directory is set to `/Scripts/Windows`.

Also ensure you have MongoDB installed and running, and have also set the username and password in `Backend/.env` as well as the other necessary secrets.

### Installation:
Run the following `.bat` files to setup the various components:
1) Backend: `install_backend.bat`
2) Frontend: `install_frontend.bat`

### Running:
Open multiple terminal sessions, running one script in each:

1) Backend: `run_backend.bat`
2) Frontend: `run_frontend.bat`
3) (MongoDB: `run_database.bat`)
